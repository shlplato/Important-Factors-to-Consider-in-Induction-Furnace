# Important-Factors-to-Consider-in-Induction-Furnace
The efficiency of an induction heating system for a specific application depends on several factors: 
the characteristics of the part itself, the design of the inductor, the capacity of the power supply, and the amount of temperature
change required for the application.     
The Characteristics of the Part METAL OR PLASTIC To begin with, induction heating works straightforwardly just with conductive materials, 
ordinarily metals. Plastics and other non-conductive materials can frequently be heated by implication by first heating a conductive metal
susceptor which exchanges heat to the non-conductive material. Attractive OR NON-MAGNETIC It is less demanding to heat attractive materials
thstanding the heat incited by swirl streams, attractive materials likewise deliver heat through what is known as the hysteresis impact 
(depicted previously). This impact stops to happen at temperatures over the "Curie" point - the temperature at which an attractive 
material loses its attractive properties. The relative resistance of attractive materials is appraised on a "penetrability" size of 100 to
500; while non-magnetics have a porousness of 1, attractive materials can have a penetrability as high as 500. THICK OR THIN With 
conductive materials, around 85% of the heating impact happens at first glance or "skin" of the part; the heating power reduces as the 
separation from the surface increases.So little or meager parts by and large heat more rapidly than vast thick parts, particularly if the
bigger parts should be heated completely through. Examination has demonstrated a relationship between the frequency of the rotating 
current and the heating profundity of entrance: the higher the frequency, the shallower the heating in the part. Frequencies of 100 to 400
kHz deliver moderately high-vitality heat, perfect for rapidly heating little parts or the surface/skin of bigger parts. For profound, 
entering heat, longer heating cycles at lower frequencies of 5 to 30 kHz have been appeared to be best.    RESISTIVITY In the event that
you utilize precisely the same procedure to heat two same size bits of steel and copper, the outcomes will be entirely distinctive. 
Why? Steel – alongside carbon, tin and tungsten – has high electrical resistivity. Since these metals emphatically oppose the present
stream, heat develops rapidly. Low resistivity metals, for example, copper, metal and aluminum take more time to heat. Resistivity 
increments with temperature, so an extremely hot bit of steel will be more responsive to induction heating than a frosty piece. 
Inductor Design It is inside of the inductor that the fluctuating attractive field required for induction heating is produced through 
the stream of exchanging current. So inductor outline is a standout amongst the most vital parts of the general framework. A very much
planned inductor gives the best possible heating example to your part and augments the productivity of the induction heating power supply,
while as yet permitting simple insertion and evacuation of the part.  Power Supply Capacity The measure of the induction power supply 
required for heating a specific part can be effectively ascertained. Initial, one must decide the amount of vitality should be 
exchanged to the work-piece. This relies on upon the mass of the material being heated, the particular heat of the material, 
and the ascent in temperature required. Heat misfortunes from conduction, convection and radiation ought to likewise be considered. 
Level of Temperature Change Required At last, the productivity of induction heating for particular application relies on upon the 
measure of temperature change required. An extensive variety of temperature changes can be accomodated; as a dependable guideline,
more induction heating power is for the most part used to build the level of temperature change.  Stead Fast Engineers is a leading
